## üöÄ EC2 Instance Setup in VPC Subnets

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch EC2 Instances

Create **one EC2 instance in each subnet**:

| Instance Name        | Subnet              | Public IP | Notes                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| ec2-public-1         | public-subnet-1     | ‚úÖ Yes    | Has both public and private IP         |
| ec2-private-1        | private-subnet-1    | ‚ùå No     | Only private IP, uses NAT for internet |
| ec2-public-2         | public-subnet-2     | ‚úÖ Yes    | Same as public-subnet-1                |
| ec2-private-2        | private-subnet-2    | ‚ùå No     | Same as private-subnet-1               |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Public IPs are auto-assigned via subnet setting.  
> Private subnet instances are isolated from inbound internet but can access internet via NAT Gateway.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Security Group (SG)

Create a **security group** named `vpc-ec2-sg` with the following rules:

#### üîê Inbound Rules

| Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Source           | Description                          |
|------------|----------|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| SSH        | TCP      | 22         | `<your-CIDR>`     | SSH from trusted IP range            | optional
| All TCP    | TCP      | 0‚Äì65535    | `10.0.0.0/16`     | Allow internal communication within VPC |

> Replace `<your-CIDR>` with your trusted IP block, e.g., `203.0.113.0/24`
> SSH access only when u have a pem key that used to ssh through mobaxterm
> For production, avoid allowing SSH from `0.0.0.0/0`

#### ‚úÖ Outbound Rules (default)

- All traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`) is allowed by default for outbound communication.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Attach IAM Role for SSM Access

- IAM Role: `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
- Attach this to **every EC2 instance**
- Required for Session Manager access (no SSH keys needed)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access Instances via SSM

- Go to AWS Systems Manager ‚Üí **Session Manager**
- Click ‚ÄúStart Session‚Äù for any EC2 with SSM agent + role attached
- No public IP or key pair needed

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Public EC2s: public + private IPs, internet-facing
- Private EC2s: only private IPs, outbound only via NAT
- Security group allows:
  - **SSH** from your IP
  - **SSM** from internet (443)
  - **Internal traffic** from within VPC CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`
- All access and communication securely controlled
